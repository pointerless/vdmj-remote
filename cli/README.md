# CLI frontend for VDMJ Remote

> This has vulnerabilities, don't use outside of known networks

This is used to display a mock-up command prompt connected to the `vdmj-remote` backend instance.
Mostly using wrappers around `react-terminal`. Additionally, it uses a `bootstrap` tab based UI to
display the other UIs embedded in the VDM scripts launched with the `vdmj-remote` instance.
